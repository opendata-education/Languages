    "In this exercise we will create a simple text classification system. We want our system to be able to determine if a sentence has a positive or a negative tone. For example, a sentence \"I love this sandwich.\" would be a positive sentence whereas \"I do not like this restaurant\" is an examples of a negative sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification in this case will be based on [Naive Bayes classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier). The idea of the classification is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create a database of sentences that are known to be either positive or negative.\n",
    "1. We create a classifier and train it using the data from our database.\n",
    "1. We define the sentence or sentences we want to evaluate.\n",
    "1. Based on individual words appearing in either the positive category or the negative category, the sentence is evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say, for example, that we have a database like in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentence | Category | \n",
    "|:---------|:--------:| \n",
    "| I love this sandwich. | pos |\n",
    "| this is an amazing place! | pos |\n",
    "| I feel very good about these beers. | pos |\n",
    "| this is my best work. | pos |\n",
    "| what an awesome view | pos |\n",
    "| I do not like this restaurant | neg |\n",
    "| I am tired of this stuff. | neg |\n",
    "| I can't deal with this\" | neg |\n",
    "| he is my sworn enemy! | neg |\n",
    "| my boss is horrible. | neg |\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be the training data and the sentences we would like to evaluate would be compared to these sentences. The more training data there is, the more accurate the results will be.\n",
